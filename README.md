# CO2-Emission-Prediction-and-Vehicle-Classification-Analysis
This repository hosts an extensive data analysis project aimed at predicting CO2 emissions from vehicles and classifying vehicles based on categorical variables. 

The project follows these main steps:

1. Comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the dataset and select suitable variables for model building.
 
2. Multiple models were built using all numerical continuous variables and a subset of these variables to predict CO2 emissions. Model performance was compared and analyzed.
 
3. An analysis was carried out to identify improvements in CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2014.
 
4. The dataset was classified using each categorical variable as the target variable to determine the most effective classification variable.
 
5. Strategies were implemented to prevent model overfitting and to validate model performance.

6. Performance measures of interest are reported with reasoning for their selection.

7. Evaluation of model deployability based on performance metrics.

8. Non-categorical variables were used to form groups, with internal and external evaluation metrics applied to determine which categorical variable best describes the formed groups.

This project provides in-depth analysis and validation of predictive models for CO2 emissions, and it demonstrates best practices in model building, validation, performance evaluation, and insights extraction."
